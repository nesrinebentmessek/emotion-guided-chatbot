        "This notebook demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a **DialoGPT** model to create an emotion-aware chatbot. The model is trained on the DailyDialog dataset, which contains multi-turn dialogues annotated with emotions. The goal is to enable the chatbot to generate responses that are sensitive to the emotional context of the conversation."
